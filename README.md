# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Assignment
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

In this assignment, I created an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject which named TidyData.txt

A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md is also created.
