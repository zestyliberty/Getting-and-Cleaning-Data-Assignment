#Introduction
The run_analysis.R includes the work that I performed to complete the project requirements listed below:
*Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
*Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
*Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
*Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
*From the data set in step 4, create a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject*
